❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum(){  return a+b; }
```

🔍 Issues:
*   ❌ The function `sum` does not declare or define the variables `a` and `b`. This will likely lead to an error (e.g., `ReferenceError: a is not defined`) when the function is executed, as the JavaScript interpreter won't know what values to add.  It also doesn't take any arguments, making it inflexible.

✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:
*   ✔️ The `sum` function now accepts two arguments, `a` and `b`, making it reusable and clear about its dependencies.
*   ✔️ The function now explicitly states what inputs it needs, avoiding reliance on variables defined in a broader scope (which is generally bad practice).

Alternatively, if the intention is to always sum specific `a` and `b` values:

```javascript
const a = 5;
const b = 10;

function sum() {
  return a + b;
}
```

In this *alternative* case, the improvements would be:

*   ✔️ The variables `a` and `b` are defined in the scope accessible to the `sum` function.
*   ✔️ Using `const` declares that `a` and `b` are fixed values (if that's the intention).

However, *prefer* the first fix (with arguments), as it is much more flexible and a better coding practice in general. The second approach should only be used when the intention is to *always* sum those specific, pre-defined values.
